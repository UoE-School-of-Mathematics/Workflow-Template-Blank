\section{Upload as ZIP}
\label{appb:zip}

You can upload a \verb|.zip| file directly to the Content Collection on your Learn page, as a ``zip package''. PLease note this method will not work if you upload the \verb|.zip| file to your general content collection, rather than on the direct on the specific learn page.

This should only be done if there is no option to upload a SCORM version of the materials.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item On your main Learn page, click the \verb|+| button to add content, then select `Content Collection' at the bottom.
    \item Select `Browse content collection'.
    \item At the top, click `Upload', then `Upload zip package'.
    \item Select `Browse local files' and select the \verb|.zip| file you have just created, or drag and drop the file into the box.
    \item Click `Submit'.
    \item Click on the folder you have just uploaded, check the box next to \verb|index.html| and click `Submit'. 
    \item Click on the \verb|...| on the right to change the name from \verb|index.html| to something more helpful for students (e.g. ``Course notes''), and click `Save'.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Important}: with this method, you then need to add permission to the folder for students to view the whole site.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item From the Learn home page, select ``Tools'', then ``Content Collection''.
    \item Click on the folder corresponding to your course.
    \item Hover on the folder containing your HTML course materials, click the arrow to get the contextual menu, and select ``Permissions''.
    \item Click on ``Select Specific Users by Place'', then ``Course''.
    \item Tick the name of your course, then tick ``All course users'' below.
    \item Tick the ``Read'' option, leave the others unticked, and also leave ``Overwrite'' unticked.
    \item Click ``Submit''.
\end{enumerate}
